    <p>At 3 o’clock on a Thursday morning in Germantown, Wis., a semitrailer trundles up to an unmarked door on a red-brick building in a strip mall on County Line Road. Two men working in the chilly dark unload the prized cargo: 2,235 pounds of chicken wings and 69 gallons of buffalo wing sauce for the evening's Sweet Sixteen basketball game between the University of Wisconsin and the University of North Carolina.</p>

    <p>Seventeen hours later, the wings are flying from a storage room cooled to 28 degrees Fahrenheit into a cramped kitchen where a dozen young women and men jostle amid a cacophony of shouted orders, sizzling grease, and the occasional shrieks of an alarm urging them to move faster. Overhead flat screens flash with orders cascading in from the 20 waiters and bartenders working tonight at Buffalo Wild Wings.</p>

    <p>Kyle Turner, a beefy 19-year-old in a black-and-yellow Wild Wings T-shirt and cap, dumps six freshly fried wings into a plastic pail labeled “Parmesan Garlic.” He pivots right, pumps one ounce of sauce into the pail, slaps on a lid, swivels left, shakes the pail with both hands, discards the lid, and drops the wings into a cardboard serving carton. It takes six seconds. Next to Turner, fellow “shaker” Brian Glover, 29, spins a pail marked “Asian Zing” with one hand, no top on the pail. “The top slows me down,” he says.</p>

    <p>The sauced wings are piled onto a tray with other wings, celery, dressings, and fried cheese curds. Eight minutes after it came in, waitress Alyssa Kark, 19, carries the order out into a sea of Wisconsin fans cheering for their Badgers to come back in the game's second half. Kark squeezes past the two-deep throng at the bar and sets her tray before three Wisconsinites gazing up at a television approximately the size of a garage door.</p>

    <p>“Awesome,” says Jesse Povlich, a 33-year-old machine shop manager wearing a red-and-white Wisconsin T-shirt. Just before biting into his first wing, he says he's not at all worried that his team is behind. "We're going to win," he says.</p>

      </div>

    <p>Povlich was correct. Wisconsin will play the University of Kentucky on Saturday for a shot at Monday's NCAA title game. But the biggest winner of March Madness might be Buffalo Wild Wings, whose "Wings Beer Sports" motto has become the recipe for the Minneapolis-based chain's improbable rise in the restaurant industry.</p>

    <p>The casual-dining sports bar has grown from 370 U.S. locations to more than1,000 in the past decade, with sales and stock price increases that are the envy of rivals like Olive Garden and Outback Steakhouse. The stock has jumped by $60 a share since October, closing Friday at $182.33((UPDATE)).</p>

    <img style="position:absolute; right:0px; z-index:-1000;" data-0="top:6000px;" data-end="top:3000px;" src="img/napkin-1.png">

    <p>While the casual-dining segment scraped out sales growth of 2 percent last year, according to NPD Group, Wild Wings posted gains of about 6 percent at company-owned and franchised stores. Even after a November price hike, the company's sales are up more than 11 percent this year, thanks partly to the 11 million wings customers gobbled on Super Bowl Sunday.</p>

    <p>Bdubs, as fans call it, plans to add 90 stores this year. Chief Executive Sally J. Smith says she thinks there's room for another 600 in the U.S., especially on the coasts. The company has more than 20 outlets in Canada, Mexico, and the Philippines, with plans to keep expanding abroad. Last year it bought stakes in emerging chains Pizza Rev and Rusty Taco, which Smith says were "little bets" that could offer growth opportunities when Wild Wings' expansion tapers off.</p>

    <p>Wild Wings restaurants aren't likely to make any Michelin lists. The beer menu tends to favor mass-market brands over craft brews. Most people don't need to leave home to watch their favorite teams on state-of-the-art tubes. Yet the 1 + 1 + 1 has added up to $1.5 billion in annual revenue. The chain appeals to customers across a wide band of the dine-out spectrum, from pub-loving sports nuts to families seeking a relatively cheap night out. </p>

    <p>The alchemy is tangible in the design of the company's new "stadia" restaurants, including the one in Germantown. The airy space, with its high ceilings and blonde finishes, is divided into several barrier-free zones. Yuppies in Badger garb gravitate to the high-top tables and wood-like floors around the bar. Families with young children lean toward the carpeted areas with lower tables and booths.</p>   

    <p>At least five of the 53 TVs are visible from any seat. There are trivia games and wing-eating contests for adults, video games on Android tablets for kids. “We consider ourselves to have 1,100 stadiums," says Ben Nelsen((CQ)), vice president of guest experience and innovation. "We want to have a piece not only of that food dollar but that entertainment dollar.”</p>

    <p>Buffalo Wild Wings has been run for almost 20 years by Smith, 58, a former tax accountant who likes spicy garlic wings and leans on her 24-year-old son for sports updates. When she and CFO Mary Twinem were pitching the company's IPO in 2003, investors kept asking, "How can two women run a sports bar-and-grill?" Smith recalls.</p>

    <p>She answers repeatedly during a tour of a new Wild Wings in Edina, Minn., near company headquarters. She explains how the logo imprinted in the company's "nucleated" glasses help sustain a foamy beer head. She tells a manager it's time to consider using IV-style bags for dumping sauce into shaking pails. "I'm not leaving until I get it," she says, only half-jokingly. She recalls how her research into competing chains made her decide that none of her restaurants would pay more than 13.1 percent of revenue for rent and depreciation. “We can’t have a $2 million restaurant with $1.8 million in sales,” she says.</p>

    <p>The company started in 1982 with one restaurant in Columbus, Ohio. When Smith joined as CFO in 1994, Wild Wings had 30-some restaurants, no financial statements, and no computers. “We hired someone to do payroll because she had a typewriter,” Smith says. The company did most of its own shipping so, “If we wanted to open a new store, we had to decide whether to buy a new truck.” A man hired as CEO in 1996 never showed up for work. “One of the directors said, ‘I guess you’re going to have to do it,’" Smith recalls.</p>

    <p>As she cleaned up the books and ditched the shipping operation, she often wondered what she'd gotten herself into. “But I knew there was something there,” she says. Buffalo wings were still a menu novelty. “I’d talk to guests and they'd say they’re coming in three or four times a week for the wings or to play Buzztime trivia.” College students wrote to ask when a Wild Wings would open near their campuses.</p>

    <p>The restaurants focused harder on sports as younger clientele came to watch cable and satellite stations they couldn't afford. "Somebody from Ohio State would say, ‘Would you put on the game?’” Smith says. Wild Wings was an early adopter of flat screens and high-definition TV. In 2006, the company aired its first national ad on ESPN.</p>

    

    <p>By then, Wild Wings counted more than 400 restaurants and was adding 50 to 60 a year. The pace picked up during the recession, perhaps because families viewed Bdubs as a two-fer. "If you're going to spend $40 on your family, the lure of being able to entertain yourself at the same time is strong," says Jennifer Bartashus, a Bloomberg restaurant industry analyst.</p>

    <p>Most casual dining restaurants were heading into a slump. They couldn't compete with McDonald's and Burger King on price. Chipotle, Panera and other "fast casual" eateries were luring millennials with fresh dishes, lower prices, and speedier service.</p>

    <div class="img_left">

      </div>
    </div>


        <p>Wild Wings sought to distance itself from its peers by emphasizing more than food. While TV spots for Chili's and Applebee's touted tumbling salads and juicy steaks at cut-rate prices, goofy Bdubs ads suggested the restaurants could keep the sports revelry going by secretly manipulating game outcomes. “People want to be in fun places,” says NPD analyst Bonnie Riggs.</p>

        <p>As the recession receded, Wild Wings added 85 stores in 2011, 74 in 2012, 101 in 2013, and 79 last year. Number 1,050 opened three days before Thanksgiving next door to a Starbucks, a Jimmy John's, and an AT&amp;T store about 20 miles northwest of Milwaukee in Germantown.</p>


        <p>The morning before the Sweet 16 contest, Germantown restaurant general manager Jillian Cabanatuan gathers 16 staffers into a pregame huddle. Most are wearing gray-and-yellow jerseys marked “82,” for the company’s founding year.</p>


        <p>Cabanatuan is expecting a packed house. In addition to the Wisconsin game, customers will be coming for discounted “Boneless Thursday” wings. Some staffers will work through the night. “It’s going to be a long day,” she tells them. Everyone touches hands and shouts, “1-2-3, Bdubs!”</p>


        <p>Buffalo Wild Wings is built for big sports events—especially March Madness. The company sold 94 million chicken wings during last year’s three-week tournament and hopes to hit 100 million this year. (As of TK, TK million have been sold since the tournament began). Wild Wings’ stock has outpaced the S&P each March for 10 years, according to Bloomberg research.</p>

        <p>The company last year hired a new ad firm, TBWA/Chiat/Day, to create 10 TV spots for this year’s tourney. Ads starring comedian Steve Rannazzisi tease viewers that they miss tournament excitement and trivia if they’re not at Wild Wings (i.e. How did the term ‘bandwagon” originate? Can a person have more than one groin?).</p>

        <p>In one spot, Rannazzisi munches a wing while warning against DVR’ing games because if they go into overtime—whereupon the ad abruptly stops, making some viewers think their DVR screwed up. “Our Facebook page lit up with people saying, ‘You got me,’” says Bob Ruhland, Wild Wings’ vice president of marketing. </p>

        <p>The campaign also seeks to entice people into the restaurants after the tournament ends, as with a “Goodbye” spot scheduled to air after Monday night’s final. Viewers will then begin seeing an ad called “Dojo” starring the tow-headed bully from the Karate Kid films. It’s part of a summer push to draw people in for sports like cricket, skate-boarding, and rugby. Wild Wings will need that traffic to approach summer 2014 sales that were boosted by World Cup soccer.</p>

        <p>Increasingly, the company is trying to engage customers when they’re not in a restaurant. Last fall, Wild Wings launched GameBreak, a mobile app for fantasy football and other games. Almost 200,000 users have registered. People who play GameBreak are more likely to return to Wild Wings and spend more money while playing. “They buy that second or third beer or maybe one more basket of wings,” Nelsen says.</p>

        <p>Lunch is another challenge. Casual dining joints have a tough time matching the service speed of a Chipotle, and there are few sports events to draw customers into a Wild Wings. The company this month((CQApril)) is introducing a simplified lunch menu and training employees to deliver orders faster.</p>

        <p>Wild Wings spent more than $100 million last year building Germantown and 45 other new restaurants intended to feel like miniature stadiums. The older restaurant model dates to 2003 and was “feeling tired,” Smith says. “One thing that happens in casual dining is, you never change.”</p>


        <p>The biggest change in the so-called stadia plan was moving the bar away from a wall and making it the hub of the establishment. At Germantown, the horseshoe-shaped bar encircles 24 taps beneath three 140-inch and seven TK-inch TV screens.</p>

        <p>Wild Wings designers worried the shift might alienate families with children. “There was a lot of debate about that,” says Thomas Berzinski, the company’s vice president of real estate. “Some families don’t want to feel like they’re sitting at a bar.” But the gigantic screens—Wild Wings calls them “jumbotrons”—enable seating at a distance while providing a focal point for everyone if, say, the Green Bay Packers are playing.</p>

        <p>Another change was installing windows high above the bar to allow more natural light. Wild Wings research showed watching newer TVs is easier on the eyes when they don’t have to adjust as severely from dark to light. The brighter environment also is family-friendly, says Bill Ferris, Wild Wings’ director of store design. Local touches help, like the framed blue-and-gold Germantown High School jerseys hanging on the walls.</p>

        <p>The company plans to add TK of the new stores this year. It’s too early to tell if they’ll be worth the investment, though Smith says so far they’re meeting the 13.1-percent test. Spiffy designs aside, “The food still has to get into the restaurant and you have to have friendly, helpful employees," she says.</p>

        <p>Late in the second half of the Wisconsin-Carolina game, Turner and Glover are still slinging sauce pails and waitresses in red beads and Badger face tattoos are hustling trays of food and drinks. By night’s end, the Germantown Bdubs will have sold more than 5,000 wings, a bit less than half that morning’s delivery.</p>

        <p>The audio feed booms from TK speakers. Most of the youngsters who earlier were mugging for photos with buffalo-headed mascot “Blazin’ Bill” have left with their parents. Two customers in Carolina blue watch as the Tar Heels’ lead dwindles.</p>

        <p>Paul Tews, 44, and his pal Steve Schraufnagel, 46, have been at their barstools since an hour before tipoff. They arrived in Wisconsin red, ate a pile of wings, lost some free raffles for gift cards, and watched guys with sauce-slicked faces compete in a wing-eating contest.</p>

        <p>Tews, a financial planner, and Schraufnagel, owner of a construction company, say the wings and beers are OK, but they really enjoy being part of the party. “It’s fun coming here and watching the other people,” Schraufnagel says. “I just hope those guys in blue-and-white aren’t happy at the end of the night.”</p>

        <p>The din swells as the game clock winds down. With 6:08 to go, Wisconsin point guard Zak Showalter, who played for Germantown High, makes a lay-up to put the Badgers ahead. The place explodes with cheers. Tews and Schraufnagel jump up and high-five. Wisconsin wins. The buddies sit back down and order another round.</p>

        <p>When Stockselius took charge the following year, he decided to overhaul the program, drawing inspiration from professional sports and recasting Melfest as a tournament like the World Cup. He added four semifinals and the second-chance round and staged them on consecutive weekends in Växjö, Norrköping, Sundsvall, Falun, and Stockholm to get the whole country involved. On the night of the final, held in Stockholm’s Globe Arena, more than 40 percent of the population watched Afro-dite, a trio of black singers, shimmy to victory.</p>

        <p>On Thursday morning, Björkman stands on the stage of Stockholm’s Friends Arena. Wrinkled and hip in black and gray, he looks like the reformed pop star he is. One by one, the 12 finalists march into a sunburst of flashing camera bulbs. They stay there until Björkman tells them to move. </p>

        <p>By Friday, the Swedish media are giving Melodifestivalen front-page billing. <em>Expressen</em> publishes an image of Saade and Zelmerlöw poised to hug, or choke, each other. It describes Saade as “cocky” and Zelmerlöw as “a mother’s dream.” </p>


        <p>Another article quotes Zelmerlöw defending his songwriters. <em>Heroes</em>, it seems, is reminiscent of the French DJ and producer David Guetta’s song <em>Lovers on the Sun</em>, so reminiscent that Zelmerlöw and his songwriters are accused of ripping it off. They deny it. Earlier in the week, his rival Saade magnanimously pooh-poohed the charges, suggesting merely that the issue could taint Zelmerlöw, and all of Sweden, if the song advanced to Eurovision.</p>

        <p>The bookies take Fjällgren, the reindeer shepherd, as an outside bet against Zelmerlöw, at 11 to 2.</p>

        <p>The night of the show, more than 30,000 people file into Friends Arena. They’re dressed to dazzle, with sequined hats and pink boas. Another 3.8 million Swedes are watching at home. Zelmerlöw’s <em>Heroes</em> sits at No. 2 on the Swedish singles charts, just behind Rihanna and ahead of Ellie Goulding. On the album charts, Fjällgren’s 2014 release <em>Goeksegh</em> has climbed back to No. 2, just behind Sam Smith and ahead of Ariana Grande, Maroon 5, and Madonna.</p>

        <p>Saade, dressed in white from head to toe, looks like a louche waiter and takes flight in a spaceship that shoots pyrotechnics. Zelmerlöw, wearing a top just tight enough to show the curves of his biceps, bends and poses dramatically while stick figures, digitally projected behind him, mimic his moves. Fjällgren’s performance oozes the same spirituality that brought him to the final. During the bridge, as fake snow falls around him, he kneels, looks straight into the camera, and says, “I am free. Sweden, this <em>joik</em> is for you.”</p>
