    <p>At 3 o’clock on a Thursday morning in Germantown, Wis., a semitrailer trundles up to an unmarked door on a red-brick building in a strip mall on County Line Road. Two men working in the chilly dark unload the prized cargo: 2,250 pounds of chicken wings and 69 gallons of buffalo wing sauce for the evening's Sweet Sixteen basketball game.</p>

    <p>Seventeen hours later, with the Wisconsin Badgers fighting from behind against the North Carolina Tar Heels, the wings are flying from a storage room cooled to 28 degrees Fahrenheit into a cramped kitchen where a dozen young women and men jostle amid a cacophony of shouted orders, sizzling grease, and the occasional shrieks of an alarm urging them to move faster. Overhead flat screens flash with orders cascading in from the 20 waiters and bartenders working tonight at Buffalo Wild Wings.</p>

    <p>Kyle Turner, a beefy 19-year-old in a black-and-yellow Wild Wings t-shirt and cap, dumps six freshly fried wings into a plastic pail labeled “Parmesan Garlic.” He pivots right, pumps one ounce of sauce into the pail, slaps on a lid, swivels left, shakes the pail with both hands, discards the lid, and drops the wings into a cardboard serving carton. It takes six seconds. Next to Turner, fellow “shaker” Brian Glover, 29, spins a pail marked Asian Zing with one hand, no top on the pail. “The top slows me down,” he says.</p>

    <p>The sauced wings are piled onto a tray alongside celery, dressings, and fried cheese curds. Eight minutes after it came in, waitress Alyssa Kark, 19, carries the order out into a sea of Wisconsin fans cheering for their Badgers to come back in the game's second half. Kark squeezes past the two-deep throng at the bar and sets her tray before three Wisconsinites gazing up at a television approximately the size of a garage door.</p>

    <p>“Awesome,” says Jesse Povlich, a 33-year-old machine shop manager wearing a red-and-white Badgers T-shirt. Just before biting into his first wing, fingertips coated in sauce, he declares himself worry-free about his team’s fate. "We're going to win," he says.</p>


    <p>Povlich was correct. Wisconsin UPDATE TK. But the biggest winner of March Madness might be Buffalo Wild Wings, whose "Wings Beer Sports" motto has become the recipe for an improbable rise in the restaurant industry.</p>

    <p>The casual-dining sports bar based in Minneapolis has grown from about 300 U.S. locations to more than 1,000 in the past decade, with sales and stock price increases that are the envy of stagnant rivals like Olive Garden and Outback Steakhouse. The stock price has jumped by $60 a share since October, opening trading Monday at $182.33((UPDATE)).</p>

    <img style="position:absolute; right:0px; z-index:-1000;" data-0="top:6000px;" data-end="top:3000px;" src="img/napkin-1.png">

    <p>The casual-dining segment characterized by table service and moderate menu prices scraped out sales growth of 2 percent last year, according to NPD Group. Buffalo Wild Wings posted gains of about 6 percent at company-owned and franchised stores. Even after a November price hike to offset the surging cost of chicken wings on the commodity market, sales were up more than 11 percent in January even before customers gobbled 11 million wings on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 1.</p>

    <p>B-Dubs, as regulars have nicknamed the chain, plans to add another 90 stores this year. Chief Executive Sally J. Smith says she thinks there's room for another 600 in North America, especially on the coasts. The company has more than 20 outlets in Canada, Mexico, and the Philippines, with plans to keep expanding abroad. Last year it bought stakes in emerging fast-casual chains PizzaRev and Rusty Taco, which Smith describes as "little bets" that could offer growth opportunities when the Buffalo Wild Wings expansion tapers off at home.</p>

    <p>Wild Wings restaurants with their bar-food fare won’t make any Michelin lists. The beer menu tends to favor middle-brow and mass-market brews. Most people don't need to leave home to watch their favorite teams on state-of-the-art tubes. Yet the simple formula has added up to $1.5 billion in annual revenue. The chain appeals to customers across a wide band of the dine-out spectrum, from pub-loving sports nuts to families seeking a relatively cheap night out. </p>

    <p>The alchemy is made tangible in the design of the company's "stadia" restaurants. The new-look facilities have been gradually rolled out across the country over the past two years. The airy space with high ceilings and blonde finishes upends the dank-and-dark stereotype of the average sports bar. The oversized restaurants, including the Germantown location, are divided into several barrier-free zones: yuppies in Badger garb gravitate to the high-top tables and wood-like floor around the bar; families with young children lean toward the carpeted areas with lower tables and booths. At least five of the 53 TVs are visible from any seat. </p>   

    <p>There are trivia games and wing-eating contests for adults, video games on Android tablets for kids. “We consider ourselves to have 1,100 stadiums," says Ben Nelsen, vice president of guest experience and innovation. "We want to have a piece not only of that food dollar but that entertainment dollar.”</p>

    <p><span class="break">Buffalo Wild Wings has been</span> run for almost 20 years by Smith, 57, an accountant who likes spicy garlic wings and leans on her 24-year-old son for sports updates. When she and CFO Mary Twinem were pitching the company's IPO in 2003, investors kept asking, "How can two women run a sports bar-and-grill?" Smith recalls.</p>

    <p>She answers repeatedly during a tour of a new Wild Wings location in Edina, Minn., near company headquarters. She explains how buffalo logos laser-etched in the company's "nucleated" glasses help sustain a foamy beer head. She tells a manager it's time to consider using IV-style bags for dumping sauce into shaking pails. "I'm not leaving until I get it," Smith says, only half-jokingly. She recalls how her research into competing chains made her decide that none of her restaurants would pay more than 13.1 percent of revenue for rent and depreciation. “We can’t have a $2 million restaurant with $1.8 million in sales,” she says.</p>

    <p>The company started in 1982 with one restaurant in Columbus, Ohio. When Smith joined as CFO in 1994, Wild Wings had around 30 restaurants, no financial statements, and no computers. “We hired someone to do payroll because she had a typewriter,” she says. The company did most of its own shipping so, “If we wanted to open a new store, we had to decide whether to buy a new truck.” A man hired as CEO in 1996 never showed up for work. “One of the directors said, ‘I guess you’re going to have to do it,’" Smith recalls.</p>

    <p>As she cleaned up the books and ditched the shipping operation, Smith often wondered what she'd gotten herself into. “But I knew there was something there,” she says. Buffalo wings were still a menu novelty. “I’d talk to guests and they'd say they’re coming in three or four times a week for the wings.” College students wrote to ask when a Wild Wings would open near their campuses.</p>

    <p>The restaurants focused harder on sports as younger clientele came to watch cable and satellite channels they couldn't afford at home. "Somebody from Ohio State would say, ‘Would you put on the game?’” Smith says. The chain became an early adopter of flatscreens and high-definition TV. Its first national ad ran on ESPN in 2006, setting off a decade of extensive sponsorship around televised sports.</p>

    <p>By then Wild Wings counted more than 400 restaurants and was adding 50 to 60 new locations per year. The pace picked up during the 2008 recession, perhaps aided by cost-conscious families who view B-Dubs as a two-fer. "If you're going to spend $40 on your family, the lure of being able to entertain yourself at the same time is strong," says Jennifer Bartashus, a Bloomberg restaurant industry analyst.</p>

    <p>The recession pushed most casual-dining restaurants into a slump from which few have emerged with vigor. The sit-down operations couldn't compete with McDonald's and Burger King on price. A rising breed of fast-casual alternatives such as Chipotle and Panera lured away millennials with fresh dishes, lower prices, and speedier service.</p>


        <p>Wild Wings sought to distance itself from its peers by emphasizing more than food. While TV spots for Chili's and Applebee's touted tumbling salads and juicy steaks at cut-rate prices, goofy B-Dubs ads suggested the restaurants could keep the sports revelry going by secretly manipulating game outcomes. “People want to be in fun places,” says NPD analyst Bonnie Riggs.</p>

        <p>The recession ended with continued expansion: Buffalo Wild Wings added 85 stores in 2011, 74 in 2012, 101 in 2013, and 79 last year. At Olive Garden, by contrast, only TK new restaurants have been opened since YEAR. </p>

        <p><span class="break">The Germantown B-Dubs&mdash;restaurant No. 1,050</span>&mdash;opened three days before Thanksgiving 2014 next door to a Starbucks, a Jimmy John's, and an AT&amp;T store about 20 miles northwest of Milwaukee. On the morning before the Sweet 16 contest, the Germantown general manager, Jillian Cabanatuan, gathers 16 staffers into a pregame huddle. Most wear gray-and-yellow jerseys marked “82,” for the company’s founding year.</p>


        <p>Cabanatuan is expecting a packed house. In addition to the Wisconsin-North Carolina game, customers will be coming for discounted “Boneless Thursday” wings. Some staffers will work through the night. “It’s going to be a long day,” she tells them. Everyone touches hands and shouts, “1-2-3, B-Dubs!”</p>


        <p>Buffalo Wild Wings is built for big sports events—especially March Madness. The company sold 94 million chicken wings during last year’s three-week tournament and hopes to hit 100 million this year. Wild Wings’ stock has outpaced the S&amp;P 500 each March for 10 years, according to Bloomberg research.</p>

        <p>Moving that many wings is nowhere near as economical as it was a decade ago, before B-Dubs embarked on its expansion. The budget-friendly chicken part has undergone large fluctuations over that span. “ ‘Wild wings’ is pretty much a description of the market,” says agricultural industry consultant Thomas Elam of FarmEcon LLC in Carmel, Ind.</p>

        <p>A U.S. Department of Agriculture chart showing wing prices for the past five years resembles a roller coaster that climbs and dives by as much as a buck a pound, bottoming at about 76 cents in 2011 and hitting a high of $2.04 in 2013. A year ago, Wild Wings was paying $1.64 a pound for traditional boned wings, including freight and handling charges. Lately the price has been $1.90. </p>

        <p>Managing the volatility is crucial because boned wings account for about 26 percent of Wild Wings’ costs. The popularity of boneless wings—actually breast meat shaped like a wing—has helped smooth out the bumps. Unlike the boned offerings, the company buys its boneless meat on long-term contracts.</p>

        <p>Chickens are grown mainly for the breast meat. Wings are a small bonus. Producers decide how many birds go to market depending on breast demand and variables like rainfall, feed costs, and whether foreign customers are limiting U.S. imports. Those decisions ultimately push wing prices up or down, sometimes in dramatic ways.</p>


        <p>Producers in the past decade have been growing bigger birds to take advantage of lower feed costs. Those plumper birds yield meatier wings—but still no more than two per chicken. Shipments that once brought 0 wings per pound suddenly switched to just six or seven. Wild Wings responded by changing its menu from per-piece servings to four standard order sizes: Snack, Small, Medium, and Large. The numbers of wings in each order changes depending on the size of pieces. The chain has already raised menu prices to offset rising costs has said it will do so again this year.</p>

        <div class="img_right">

        <p>The B-Dubs menu sells wings for about $1 apiece on average, and they’re available in an almost comical number of varieties: boneless and boned, five dry seasonings, and 17 sauces with names like TK and TK arrayed on a heat scale. It’s not on the menu, but savvy diners can request drumstick-only orders. </p>


        <p>Moving wings at $1 piece hasn’t always proved easy. McDonald’s in 2013 tried to sell Mighty Wings at about the same price. The new menu item flopped even after McDonald’s lowered the price, and the burger giant was stuck selling millions of pounds of leftover frozen wings.</p>

        <p>Commodity wing prices are often the first thing analysts ask about on Wild Wings earnings conference calls. Partly to calm Wall Street, the company is changing the way it buys boned wings. Until now, the price paid by the company has been determined by the average daily price for the prior month reported by publisher Urner Barry of Bayville, N.J. A new arrangement with suppliers starting on April 15 will set a ceiling and a floor on prices. </p>

        <p>Smith declines to specify the range, but says Wild Wings and suppliers will share the pain or benefit when prices fall outside of it. She also has some free advice for speculators looking to get rich quick: Anyone who can pinpoint why wing prices fluctuate so much “can make a lot of money,” she says.</p>

        <p><span class="break">Drawing crowds for tentpole events</span> is easier than when the sports calendar is empty, but Wild Wings still invests heavily in big games. The company last year hired a new ad firm, TBWA/Chiat/Day, to create 10 TV spots for this year’s college basketball tournament. Ads starring comedian Steve Rannazzisi from the FX sitcom “The League” tease viewers that they risk missing tournament excitement and trivia—how did the term “bandwagon” originate?—if they’re not at Buffalo Wild Wings.  </p>

        <p>In one spot, Rannazzisi munches a wing while warning against DVR’ing games because if they go into overtime—whereupon the ad abruptly stops, making some viewers think their DVR screwed up. “Our Facebook page lit up with people saying, ‘You got me,’” says Bob Ruhland, vice president of marketing at Wild Wings.</p>

        <p>The March Madness ad campaign also seeks to entice people into the restaurants after the tournament ends, as with a “Goodnight Madness” spot scheduled to air after Monday night’s final. Viewers will then begin seeing a non-NCAA commercial starring the tow-headed bully from the Karate Kid films. It’s part of a summer push to draw people in for less-popular sports like skate-boarding, and rugby. Wild Wings will need that traffic to approach summer 2014 sales that were boosted by World Cup soccer.</p>

        <p>Increasingly, the company is trying to engage customers when they’re not in a restaurant. Last August Wild Wings launched GameBreak, a mobile app for fantasy football and other games. Almost 200,000 users have registered. People who play GameBreak are more likely to return to Wild Wings and spend more money while playing. “They buy that second or third beer or maybe one more basket of wings,” Nelsen says.</p>

        <p>Another challenge is lunch, which accounts for around a fifth of the total revenue at Wild Wings. Matching the service speed of Chipotle for weekday customers who want to get in and out fast is difficult. Midday alcohol sales are low, and there aren’t many sports events around noon to draw fans.</p>


        <p>But if the company wants to hit its own goal of doubling average store sales in 10 years, it can’t rely solely on opening new locations. “Lunch has to play a bigger part,” CEO Smith says. The company this month is introducing a simplified menu of dishes that can be prepared faster, including a taco-like chicken “buffalito” and a prime rib sandwich. Wild Wings also has been training employees to deliver faster during lunch.</p>


        <p>Another major change has come with the continued roll out of redesigned restaurants. Wild Wings and its franchisees spent more than $100 million last year building Germantown and 58 other new restaurants intended to feel like miniature stadiums. The older restaurant model dates to 2003 and was “feeling tired,” Smith says. “One thing that happens in casual dining is you never change.”</p>

        <p>The biggest change in the so-called stadia plan was moving the bar away from a wall and making it the hub of the establishment. At Germantown, the horseshoe-shaped bar encircles 40 taps beneath three 140-inch and seven 40-inch TV screens.</p>


        <p>Wild Wings designers worried the shift might alienate families with children. “There was a lot of debate about that,” says Thomas Berzinski, the company’s vice president of real estate. “Some families don’t want to feel like they’re sitting at a bar.” But the gigantic screens—Wild Wings calls them “jumbotrons”—enable seating at a distance while providing a focal point for everyone if, say, the Green Bay Packers are playing.</p>

        <p>The stadia design installs more windows to allow more natural light. Wild Wings research showed watching newer TVs is easier on the eyes that don’t have to adjust as severely from dark to light. The brighter environment also is family-friendly, says Bill Ferris, the company’s director of store design. Local touches also help, such as the framed blue-and-gold Germantown High School jerseys hanging on the walls.</p>

        <p>The company plans to add at least 90 of the new stores this year. It’s too early to tell if they’ll be worth the investment, though Smith says so far they’re meeting the 13.1-percent test. Spiffy designs aside, “The food still has to get into the restaurant and you have to have friendly, helpful employees," she says.</p>

        <p><span class="break">Late in the second half</span> of the Wisconsin-Carolina game, Glover and his wing-shaker colleagues are still slinging sauce pails, and waitresses in red beads and Badger face tattoos are hustling trays of food and drinks. By night’s end, the Germantown B-Dubs will have sold 8,500 wings, a bit less than half that morning’s delivery.</p>

        <p>The audio feed booms from 40 speakers. Most of the youngsters who earlier were mugging for photos with buffalo-headed mascot “Blazin’ Bill” have left with their parents. Two customers in Carolina blue watch as the Tar Heels’ lead dwindles.</p>

        <p>Paul Tews, 44, and his pal Steve Schraufnagel, 46, have been at their barstools since an hour before tipoff. They arrived in Wisconsin red, ate a pile of wings, lost some free raffles for gift cards, and watched guys with sauce-slicked faces compete in a wing-eating contest.</p>

        <p>Tews, a financial planner, and Schraufnagel, owner of a construction company, say the wings and beers are OK, but they really enjoy being part of the party. “It’s fun coming here and watching the other people,” Schraufnagel says. “I just hope those guys in blue-and-white aren’t happy at the end of the night.”</p>

        <p>The din swells as the game clock winds down. With 6:08 to go, Wisconsin point guard Zak Showalter, who played for Germantown High, makes a lay-up to put the Badgers ahead. The place explodes with cheers. Tews and Schraufnagel jump up and high-five. Wisconsin wins. The buddies sit back down and order another round. <img class="closer" src="img/favicon-32x32.png"></p>
